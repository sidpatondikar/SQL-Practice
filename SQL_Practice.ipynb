        "\n",
        "Subqueries, also known as nested queries or subselects, are SQL queries that are embedded within other SQL queries. They can be used in various ways to retrieve data and perform operations. However, the impact of subqueries on the efficiency of a query can vary depending on how they are used. Let's explore subqueries and their impact on query efficiency with code examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using Subqueries Efficiently:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Subqueries can help improve query efficiency by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts. For example, you can use a subquery to retrieve a specific value that you then use in the main query. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have a table `orders` and a table `customers`. You want to retrieve orders made by customers with a specific last name. You can use a subquery to first find the customer IDs with the desired last name and then use that result in the main query:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "-- Subquery to retrieve customer IDs with the last name 'Smith'\n",
        "SELECT customer_id\n",
        "FROM customers\n",
        "WHERE last_name = 'Smith';\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Main query to retrieve orders made by those customers\n",
        "SELECT order_id, order_date\n",
        "FROM orders\n",
        "WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE last_name = 'Smith');\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the subquery filters customers efficiently, and the main query retrieves orders made by those specific customers. This approach can enhance query readability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact of Inefficient Subqueries:**\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, poorly designed or inefficient subqueries can negatively impact query performance. For instance, using a subquery that retrieves data for each row in a result set can be inefficient. Consider this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have a table `employees` and you want to find employees whose salary is higher than the average salary of all employees. Using a subquery to calculate the average salary for each row can lead to poor performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "-- Inefficient subquery\n",
        "SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary\n",
        "FROM employees\n",
        "WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the subquery is executed for each row in the `employees` table, which can be resource-intensive for large datasets. A more efficient approach would be to calculate the average salary once and then use it in the main query.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using Efficient Subqueries:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a more efficient way to achieve the same result:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "-- Efficient query with a common table expression (CTE)\n",
        "WITH avg_salary_cte AS (\n",
        "    SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary\n",
        "    FROM employees\n",
        ")\n",
        "SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary\n",
        "FROM employees\n",
        "WHERE salary > (SELECT avg_salary FROM avg_salary_cte);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, a common table expression (CTE) is used to calculate the average salary only once, and that result is then used in the main query. This approach is more efficient as it avoids redundant calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, subqueries can impact query efficiency positively when used wisely to break down complex tasks, but they can also lead to performance issues if used inefficiently. Understanding when and how to use subqueries effectively is essential for optimizing SQL queries."
